# Description
The goal of this project is to provide an exploratory interface that allows user's to see how the emission of 
greenhouse gases in the United States and the rest of the world has changed over the last decade. When greenhouse gases 
are emitted into our atmosphere, they trap the sun's heat, leading to global warming and climate change. We feel that it 
is important for our readers to understand where the highest concentrations of these gases have been coming from.
